# ⚡ RuleOps — Salesforce Recommendation Rule Manager

> *Because manually hunting through Salesforce rules should be illegal* 🚫

A slick, browser-based tool built for **US** to manage recommendation rules without drowning in Salesforce. Upload a CSV, make your changes, export, done. ✅

## 🎯 What it does

- 👥 See every team member and their assigned rules at a glance
- ✏️ Edit rule parameters — localities, lead sources, vendor grades, operations, verticals
- ➕ Assign agents to existing rules or spin up brand new ones
- 🚨 Instantly spot agents with **no rules** or **incomplete profiles**
- 🔄 Replace former agents in active rules (bye~ 👋)
- 📤 Export a Salesforce-ready CSV in the exact bulk upload format

## 🔄 The Workflow

### After making changes in Salesforce

```
Salesforce export → Upload Rules CSV → Make adjustments → Export CSV → Upload back to Salesforce
```

1. Export your latest rules from Salesforce
2. Click **↑ Upload Rules** in the app
3. Tweak whatever needs tweaking
4. Hit **↓ Export CSV**
5. Import back into Salesforce 🎉

### New joiner? No problem 🙋

1. Find them in the sidebar (they'll have a 🔴 red dot)
2. Click **Edit Profile** → set their account sources & business types
3. Click **+ Assign to existing rule** or **+ New rule**
4. Export & import to Salesforce — done!

### Replacing a former agent 👋

1. Dashboard will shout at you with a red alert
2. Click **Replace agent** → pick someone from the list
3. Export CSV — new agent row appears with blank IDs (Salesforce handles the rest)
4. Manually delete the old agent's record in Salesforce
